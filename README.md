# üí´ About Me:
Hi! I'm a passionate 21-year-old mobile developer, specialized in creating applications for Android and iOS. My expertise spans both Android (Kotlin, XML, Jetpack Compose) and iOS (Swift, SwiftUI), enabling me to build robust and efficient applications on both platforms.
<br>
<br>On my journey as a developer, I have founded two organizations on GitHub where I share my continuous learning and progress:
<br>
<br>**Personal Projects**: A space where I experiment and refine my skills through personal projects.
<br>**Advanced Practices**: This is where I uploaded all the code for the advanced Android and iOS practices that I completed during my last course.
<br>
<br>Although my personal GitHub profile does not yet have public repositories, I am actively involved in the development of an application that will soon be available on both the Google Play Store and the iOS App Store. This project, currently in a private repository, is a testament to my commitment to creating high-quality mobile solutions.
<br>
<br>I am always looking to learn and grow. My next goal is to dive into the world of Kotlin Multiplatform, a technology that will allow me to take my mobile development experience to the next level.
